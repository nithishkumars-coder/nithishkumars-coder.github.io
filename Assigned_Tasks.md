# Introduction

Python, the brainchild of Guido van Rossum, is a powerful, high-level, interpreted programming language that has been widely used across industries and sectors since its inception in 1991. With a clear syntax, Python is favored by many for its readability and ease of understanding, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

In this assignment, we will dive deep into Python's philosophy, the differences between Python 2 and 3, setting up a Python environment, working with a Python interpreter, and writing a Python program. By the end of this assignment, you will have a solid understanding of these foundational principles and will be equipped with the necessary knowledge to build complex Python applications.

# Detailed Tasks

### Task 1: Understand Python's Philosophy (The Zen of Python)

1. In a Python interpreter, use the import this command to display the Zen of Python. Spend time understanding each principle. Reasearch and understand How do these principles influence Python's design and your usage of the language?

    Expected Outcome: A deep understanding of Python's guiding principles and how they influence the language's design and syntax.

<br>

### Task 2: Understand the Differences between Python 2 and Python 3

1. Conduct a research study on the differences between Python 2 and Python 3. Focus on aspects like print function, integer division, Unicode support, and syntax changes.

2. Write a Python 2 program and then migrate it to Python 3. Document the changes needed for the migration process.

    Expected Outcome: A comprehensive understanding of the differences between Python 2 and Python 3 and the ability to migrate code from Python 2 to Python 3.

<br>

### Task 3: Setting up a Python Environment

1. Set up a Python environment using virtualenv. Document the steps taken during the process.

2. Install different versions of Python on the same machine and switch between them.

3. Use pip to install, update, and remove a package. Document the commands used and their outputs.

Expected Outcome: Ability to set up a Python environment, switch between Python versions, and manage Python packages.

<br>

### Task 4: Working with Python Interpreter

1. Explore the interactive mode of Python interpreter by running Python commands.

2. Use the Python interpreter to execute a Python script file.

3. Experiment with the Python shell IPython. Compare its features with the regular Python interpreter.

<br>

## Expected Outcome: 
Proficiency in working with Python interpreter, running Python scripts, and using an enhanced Python shell like IPython. Submission Guideline

1. For each task, create a separate directory. Place all relevant files (including Python scripts, documentation, etc.) in the respective directory.

2. Once you complete all tasks, commit your changes for each task with a meaningful commit message.

3. Push your changes to your GitHub repository.

4. Create a pull request for the repository.

<br>

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Understanding of Python's Philosophy: Clarity and depth of the Zen of Python interpretation.

2. Python 2 vs Python 3: Understanding and correctly documenting the differences, demonstrated by the migrated code.

3. Python Environment Setup: Success in setting up a functional Python environment and effectively managing Python versions and packages.

4. Proficiency with Python Interpreter: Demonstrating proficiency in using Python interpreter, running scripts, and using IPython shell.
